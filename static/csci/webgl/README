Description:
		I had a tough time getting started with WebGL.
	I wasn't sure where to begin, and I couldn't really
	think of anything cool to do (that was possible :P).
	I finally was able to spend several hours on it
	tonight, and finally started to make some progress!
	So I decided that a basic robot wouldn't be too hard
	to build with triangles ... It wasn't too bad, but I
	hand coded in every vertex just to test my WebGL 
	knowledge and to practice understanding the 3D 
	vertex array, and how it is processed. I realized
	that I could probably put some simple controls
	on the HTML page and have them edit the values of 
	the vertexes. So I added some jQuery sliders to 
	let you edit the robot.
